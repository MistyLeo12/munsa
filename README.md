# MUNSA Website

## About 

Website made for Model United Nations San Antonio--the largest student run Model United Nations conference that attracts students from multiple countires. This is also one of the first websites I created that had thousands of visitors from all around the globe. It does not follow best pactices but is an example of how far I've come along in developing and best practices. As part of the team that ran that years MUNSA I created this website along with an iOS app for the conference that was on the AppStore. That app gave live push notifications, schedules, maps, and other useful information.


## What I Learned
I improved my web dev skills. Learnt how to create a website from scratch using CSS, HTML, and JS. This is also the first website that I deployed and hosted with a ".org" domain. This project still has a special place in my heart.
